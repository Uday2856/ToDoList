Project description: 

In this project, I created a modern to do list. Here one  can add a new task to the list using the input field. 
Additionaly, my to-do list is unique in that even after refreshing the page, the tasks remain saved.
By utilizing JavaScript, here we could see how to set and get items from local storage.
With each task, there are two icons: 
1. A check mark and
2. A trash bin.
The check mark allows you to mark the task as completed, while the trash bin lets you delete the task.
Each task will also be saved in the local storage.
 -Uday...
